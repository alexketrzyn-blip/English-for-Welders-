## 📄 Course Abstract

This comprehensive 20-hour vocational English course is designed specifically for job seekers and individuals transitioning into the welding industry. The curriculum bridges the gap between technical manual skills and professional communication, focusing on the most prevalent industrial methods: **MIG/MAG, TIG, and MMA**.

### Key Instructional Features:
* **Safety-First Approach:** Integrated Health and Safety (HSE) modules based on professional Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), covering PPE and workstation ergonomics.
* **Technical Writing Integration:** The course utilizes authentic technical instructions for MIG/MAG welding, focusing on the "Three Core Elements" (Distance, Angle, and Movement) to minimize common defects such as porosity and burn-back.
* **Methodological Versatility:** Equal emphasis is placed on gas-shielded methods (141, 131/135) and electric arc welding (111), ensuring students are prepared for diverse workshop environments.
* **Career Readiness:** Beyond technical skills, the program includes dedicated modules for interpreting ISO/EN welding symbols, reading WPS (Welding Procedure Specifications), and succeeding in technical job interviews.
